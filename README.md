# storybook
Unless you want to muck around in setup.sh or do things manually, just clone to ~/Projects.

If you're on a Mac, execute setup.sh. We're going to make ~/Projects and put some things there.  If it's not there or your project is somewhere else, this is going to barf when it hits the migration.

Once it is complete, set your virtual env to 'env'.

Once in the virtual env,  python storybook/manage.py runserver.
